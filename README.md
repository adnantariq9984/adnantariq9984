- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adnantariq9984
- ğŸ‘€ I am video director & suddenly out of no where i became passionately curious about Open Ai which lead me to Github to find out how amazing it is to be a part of future. Getting containers from here and learning to create them locally is all the happiness.
 ğŸ“« Feel free to reach and teach :)
